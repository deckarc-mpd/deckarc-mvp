// Resolves a spoken agent name ("Marcus", "Natalie") to its stable agent id
// using the AI Employee Identities mapping — the SAME FROZEN_AGENT_SEED
// registry.ts already exports. This is the ONE place display names are
// read at all; the resolved AgentId is what every downstream call uses.
// This does not violate the Identity spec's "never branch business logic
// on displayName" rule — that rule is about mid-flow decisions, not about
// converting a spoken name into a stable id once, at the boundary, before
// any SOP/tool call happens.
